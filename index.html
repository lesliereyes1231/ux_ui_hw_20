                      Buy a duck stamp

                      Overstimulated by amount of text and images
                      Complicated navigation bars 
                      Catergories could be refined and tidied up more

                    <p>In this phase, we also developed our style guide for use in our later prototypes.</p>

                        <p>This redesign was a great learning experience, one thing we can take away from this project is centering this around the users needs and familiarizing ourselves with figma micro animations a bit more. 

                          If we were to continue elaborating on this redesign we would create more micro-animations and use auto layout more for smoother more even animations</p>
